# Navigating-Customer-Behavior-RFM-Analysis

In the dynamic landscape of retail, understanding customer behavior is paramount. Enter RFM analysis – a game-changer in deciphering the intricacies of customer value. Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis goes beyond conventional methods, offering a holistic approach to customer segmentation.

This project discovers and tracks the recency of customer transactions, the frequency of their purchases, and the monetary value unveiling the patterns that shape customer engagement, allowing for targeted strategies.
 A dataset of retail transactions is used for analysing RFM metrics.
 # Insights
 
A granular clustering was obtained that unveiled a perspective on diverse customer behaviors, offering valuable insights for crafting targeted marketing strategies and customer engagement initiatives.
For instance, following clusters were identified:
Cluster 0 represented a sizable segment of regular customers with a balanced mix of moderate frequency and spending.

Cluster 1 encompassed customers who haven’t made recent purchases, exhibiting lower frequency and spending levels.

Cluster 2 gave a distinctive, albeit smaller, group characterized by very recent purchases, exceptionally high frequency, and substantial spending.

Cluster 3 signified premium customers with recent purchases, high frequency, and the highest spending levels.
